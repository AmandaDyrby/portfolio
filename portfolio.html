      <h1>FILMING</h1>
      <!-- img -->
      <p>
        This was the first project. Something something bout the filming
        process. Storyboards, camera angles etc. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
        consectetur adipiscing elit. Donec ligula arcu, cursus eu porttitor in,
        ornare at augue. <br />
        <br />You can watch the whole video here:
      </p>

        ><img src="img/watchVideo.svg" alt="watch video"

      <h1>FIGURING OUT HTML AND CSS</h1>
      <!-- img -->
      <p>
        This was my first time coding in HTML and CSS. <br />
        I had all of the content handed to me, and then I had to follow a given
        wireframe. It doesn't look the best, but we all start somewhere and I
        learned a lot from it.
        <br />
        <br />
        You can view the full site here:

      /></a>

      <h1>UI/UX FOR WEB</h1>
      <!-- img -->
      <p>
        Similar to the previous project, but this time I made all the content as
        well as the wireframes. <br />
        I learned a lot about testing and eventually made a high fidelity
        prototype in Figma. Unfortunately I got really sick and couldn't code
        the prototype to create the final website.

        <br />
        <br />You can see the high fidelity prototype here:

      <h1>ANIMATION AND GAME DESIGN</h1>
      <!-- img -->
      <p>
        Not only was this my introduction to JavaScript, it was also the first
        time a had to put my knowledge of UI and UX into a different media than
        web. <br />It was the most challenging, but also the most fun out of all
        the projects I did this semester. <br />
        <br />
        You can play the game here:
      </p>

      <a href="[insert link]"><img src="img/playGame.svg" alt="play game" /></a>

      <img src="img/line.svg" alt="line" />

      <h1>INTERVIEWING AND VIDEO EDITING</h1>
      <!-- img -->
      <p>
        Like the very first project, this was a challenge in filmmaking. Unlike
        the first project, this also included an interview. I wanted good
        answers, so I learned how to ask good questions. <br />After I had done
        the filming, I edited it all, which was a challenge as it had to be
        exactly 60 seconds +- 0 secs! <br />
        <br />
        You can watch the whole video here:
      </p>

      <a href="[insert link]"
        ><img src="img/watchVideo.svg" alt="watch video"
      /></a>

      <img src="img/line.svg" alt="line" />

      <h1>REDESIGN OF A WEBSITE</h1>
      <!-- img -->
      <p>
        I had learned how to create a website from scratch and how to make it
        exactly as i wanted it with its own identity, but this time (in a group
        project) I had to works with the already existing identity of a
        restaurant, and make it better.
