      <p>
        This was the first project. Something something bout the filming
        process. Storyboards, camera angles etc. I recommend watching it mute
        however - I am not very musically gifted. <br />
        <br />You can watch the whole video here:

      <p>
        This was my first time coding in HTML and CSS. <br />
        I had all of the content handed to me, and then I had to follow a given
        wireframe. It doesn't look the best, but we all start somewhere and I
        learned a lot from it.

      <h1>UI/UX FOR WEB</h1>

      <p>
        Similar to the previous project, but this time I made all the content as
        well as the wireframes. <br />
        I learned a lot about testing and eventually made a high fidelity
        prototype in Figma. Unfortunately I got really sick and couldn't code
        the prototype to create the final website.

        <br />
        <br />You can see the prototype here:

        Not only was this my introduction to JavaScript, it was also the first
        time a had to put my knowledge of UI and UX into a different media than
        web. <br />It was the most challenging, but also the most fun out of all
        the projects I did this semester. <br />
        <br />
        You can play the game here:

      <h1>INTERVIEWING AND VIDEO EDITING</h1>
      <img
        class="portfolioIMG"
        src="img/bluePassionsvideo.webp"
        alt="setting up for interview"
      />
      <p>
        Like the very first project, this was a challenge in filmmaking. Unlike
        the first project, this also included an interview. I wanted good
        answers, so I learned how to ask good questions. <br />After I had done
        the filming, I edited it all, which was a challenge as it had to be
        exactly 60 seconds +- 0 secs! <br />
        <br />

      <h1>REDESIGN OF A WEBSITE</h1>
      <img
        class="portfolioIMG"
        src="img/blueT5.webp"
        alt="Hanoi Alley website"
      />
      <p>
        I had learned how to create a website from scratch and how to make it
        exactly as i wanted it with its own identity, but this time (in a group
        project) I had to works with the already existing identity of a
        restaurant, and make it better.
